# Kernighan-Lin-Algorithm
A heuristic algorithm for finding partitions of graphs.
# Node File:
Must have one node per line. For example:  
  a  
  b  
  c  
  d  
# Edge File:
Must have one edge (Node1 followed by '-' and Node2) per line. For example:  
a-b   
c-d  

# Steps to Run: 
pip install networkx matplotlib   
python KL_NoWeights.py <Node File> <Edge File>
